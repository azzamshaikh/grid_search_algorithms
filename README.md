# Grid Search Algorithms
This repo contains code to implement various grid search algorithms.

Below are a few GIFs of breadth first search, depth first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm in action.

## Running Code

To run the code, download this repository and run the RunGridSearchAlgorithms.py file.

The obstacle field density can also be changed. In the RunGridSearchAlgorithms.py, the argument in the following function below defines the obstacle density:

`go, rate = generateObstacleField(50)`
